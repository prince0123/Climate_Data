# Climate_Data

üîç Data Collection and Cleaning:

Datasets: Utilized multiple datasets including daily, hourly, monthly, and three-hour interval climate data.
Python: Leveraged Python for initial data cleaning, handling missing values, and preprocessing. Libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and statsmodels were instrumental in transforming raw data into a usable format.
üìä Data Analysis and Visualization:

Power BI: Imported cleaned datasets into Power BI for advanced data transformation and visualization.
Created interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics such as temperature trends, precipitation patterns, and wind speeds.
Used Power Query Editor in Power BI to handle data transformations, create calculated columns, and manage null values.
Key Insights:
Identified significant temperature trends over the past decades, highlighting warming patterns.
Analyzed seasonal precipitation changes, providing insights into shifting weather patterns.
Visualized wind speed and direction data to understand prevailing wind conditions.
Why This Matters:
Understanding historical climate data is crucial for predicting future trends and making informed decisions in fields like agriculture, urban planning, and disaster management. By combining Python's data processing capabilities with Power BI's powerful visualization tools, we can derive actionable insights from complex datasets.

Tools and Technologies:
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels
